        <h2>What This Series Is</h2>

        <p>
          This series establishes a permanent enforcement standard for public
          legitimacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          It does not propose reforms, incentives, or transparency initiatives.
          It defines a gate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any system, institution, or claim that cannot survive continuous
          public inspection loses authority by definition.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>The Legitimacy Test (Permanent)</h2>

        <p>
          A public claim, decision, or system is legitimate <strong>only if</strong>
          all three conditions are satisfied at all times:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuous observability</strong> — real-world state and
            change are visible in real time
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Full auditability</strong> — every action and transformation
            is reconstructible by external parties
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Immediate revocability</strong> — any claim loses authority
            instantly upon error or failed contact with reality
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Any aspect failing even one condition is not partially legitimate.
          It is illegitimate.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Enforcement Principle</h2>

        <p>
          This standard is enforced at the interface layer.
        </p>

        <p>
          No claim may be displayed, summarized, or acted upon unless its full
          provenance, audit chain, and revocation criteria are visible to any
          observer.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are no operator overrides, no silent corrections, and no private
          exceptions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rollback without trace is impossible without destroying the interface
          itself.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Why Enforcement Comes First</h2>

        <p>
          Most institutional failure is not caused by lack of intelligence or
          effort.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is caused by the ability to hide drift, defer accountability, and
          preserve authority after reality has diverged.
        </p>

        <p>
          This series removes that ability.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meaning, trust, and coordination emerge only after legitimacy is
          enforced—not before.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Series Deployment Order</h2>

        <p>
          Enforcement begins where authority is least defensible without truth:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Budget</strong> — public money as reference reality
          </li>
          <li>
            Energy — generation, storage, loss, and delivery claims
          </li>
          <li>
            Health — outcomes, capacity, and risk declarations
          </li>
          <li>
            Infrastructure — condition, exposure, and maintenance truth
          </li>
          <li>
            Defense — scope, readiness, and authorization boundaries
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          No later domain may operate under a lower legitimacy bar than an
          earlier one.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Refusal Clause (Non-Negotiable)</h2>

        <p>
          Refusal to deploy or maintain this standard is not neutral.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is a public admission of illegitimacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any institution claiming authority while resisting observability,
          auditability, or revocability is declaring:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Our authority cannot withstand public contact with reality.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          That declaration remains visible until corrected.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>What This Series Does Not Do</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>It does not choose policies</li>
          <li>It does not optimize outcomes</li>
          <li>It does not predict success</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It determines whether claims are allowed to stand.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Canonical Statement</h2>

        <p>
          A civilization-scale capacity for epistemic emancipation—defined by
          continuous observability of truth, auditability of learning, and
          revocability of all claims on contact with reality—is the foundation
          for meaningful futures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nothing else confers durable legitimacy, agency, or resilience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Everything proceeds or collapses on this basis alone.
        </p>
