        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>
          Persistent governance failures are frequently misdiagnosed as
          incompetence, political stasis, or administrative delay. While such
          explanations may be convenient, they often obscure a deeper and more
          consequential failure mode: epistemic lock-in.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these cases, risk is acknowledged, data is sufficient, and
          intervention capacity exists—yet understanding does not change.
          Misclassifying this condition as procedural or political failure
          collapses diagnosis and misassigns responsibility.
        </p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Epistemic Lock-In After Risk Acknowledgment is a governance failure mode
          in which decision-makers explicitly recognize material risk, possess
          credible and sufficient information, and retain feasible capacity to
          respond—where action itself is not net-negative—yet remain unable to
          revise or abandon dominant interpretive frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The failure is not epistemic ignorance, procedural inertia, omission,
          or action paralysis. It is an inability to update the governing model
          of reality itself despite disconfirming evidence.
        </p>

        <h2>Failure Mode Definition</h2>
        <p>
          Epistemic Lock-In After Risk Acknowledgment occurs only when all of the
          following conditions are simultaneously satisfied:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Material risk is explicitly acknowledged by decision-makers</li>
          <li>Signaling is timely, credible, and sufficient</li>
          <li>Practical capability to act exists within authority</li>
          <li>Available actions are not inherently net-negative</li>
          <li>
            Interpretive frameworks remain unchanged despite evidence requiring
            reframing
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Mechanism of Lock-In</h2>
        <p>
          Once established, epistemic lock-in is reinforced through structural
          mechanisms rather than individual error:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Model Sanctification:</strong> Dominant frameworks become
            non-falsifiable by institutional convention
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consensus Gravity:</strong> Shared interpretation stabilizes
            belief independent of evidence
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reputational Coupling:</strong> Authority becomes tied to
            maintaining existing models
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Parameter Absorption:</strong> New data is treated as noise
            or adjustment rather than paradigm violation
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Distinction From Adjacent Failure Modes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Action Threshold Collapse:</strong> Action is foreclosed by
            unavoidable harm; here, action is feasible but understanding does
            not update
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Procedural Entrenchment:</strong> Rules block action; here,
            interpretation blocks meaning
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Neglect or Omission:</strong> Risk is unrecognized; here, it
            is acknowledged
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Silent Degradation:</strong> Harm is invisible; here, harm
            is seen but cognitively contained
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Invariant Framework Declaration</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Symmetry group (𝑮):</strong> Reparameterizations of models,
          narratives, metrics, and institutional language that preserve the
          declared risk acknowledgment while allowing arbitrary reframing of
          explanation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Conserved quantity (𝑸):</strong> Formal acknowledgment of
          material risk (risk is neither denied nor retracted).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Invariant spectrum (𝑺):</strong> The set of permissible model
          states capable of producing materially different policy or action
          decisions under the acknowledged risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Failure signature on 𝑺:</strong> Collapse of the spectrum to a
          single or degenerate model class—no new interpretive states appear
          despite accumulating disconfirming evidence.
        </p>

        <h2>Why More Data Does Not Resolve It</h2>
        <p>
          Once the invariant spectrum collapses, additional data does not
          generate new models. Information is absorbed, normalized, or deflected
          to preserve interpretive continuity. The constraint is structural, not
          informational.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethical Risk of Misuse</h2>
        <p>
          This concept must not be used to excuse inaction, shield authority, or
          portray epistemic rigidity as inevitable. Invocation requires explicit
          demonstration that alternative interpretive states were available but
          institutionally suppressed.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>DOCTRINALLY VALID — REGIME-BOUNDED</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Epistemic Lock-In After Risk Acknowledgment identifies a failure of
          understanding—not knowledge, will, or capacity. Its function is
          diagnostic: to prevent moral and operational misclassification of
          epistemic failure as negligence or paralysis.
