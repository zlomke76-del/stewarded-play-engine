            Passive material cues for early cognitive erosion in long-duration spaceflight

        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>
          This document proposes a class of materials designed to make subtle,
          cumulative cognitive drift perceptible without surveillance, electronics,
          behavioral enforcement, or diagnostic claims. The intent is not to measure
          cognition, but to externalize early warning signals in environments where
          human performance degrades quietly and dangerously over time.
        </p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Long-duration space missions expose crews to monotony, isolation, disrupted
          circadian rhythms, and sustained cognitive load. Many catastrophic errors
          arise not from acute failure, but from gradual erosion of executive
          function, attention, or judgment that remains invisible to both the
          individual and the institution. This paper explores the feasibility and
          ethical constraints of intrinsic, passive materials whose physical response
          changes in proportion to cumulative human interaction patterns correlated
          with cognitive drift—without monitoring, scoring, or inference. These
          materials act as mirrors, not metrics, supporting self-awareness and
          corrective behavior while preserving autonomy and trust.
        </p>

        <h2>1. The Problem: Silent Cognitive Erosion</h2>
        <p>
          In long-duration missions, cognitive degradation often precedes visible
          failure. Fatigue, overconfidence, impatience, and attentional narrowing
          accumulate gradually, escaping episodic testing and institutional models.
          When these shifts remain unobserved, errors emerge suddenly and
          disproportionately.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Concept Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Intrinsic cognitive-drift signaling materials are engineered to respond
          progressively and irreversibly to patterns of human interaction—such as
          force variability, rhythm disruption, or overuse—that correlate with
          degraded cognitive states. These responses are passive, non-verbal, and
          unavoidable, providing environmental feedback without interpretation,
          authority, or enforcement.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Physical and Neurocognitive Plausibility</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Interaction-induced hysteresis that accumulates under erratic or excessive
            force patterns
          </li>
          <li>
            Architected materials sensitive to qualitative differences in load
            application rather than magnitude alone
          </li>
          <li>
            Temporal overuse ratchets that resist normalization of unsafe duty cycles
          </li>
          <li>
            Progressive tactile or mechanical drift that mirrors cumulative human
            degradation
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These materials do not diagnose mental state. They reflect the physical
          consequences of interaction quality back to the user in real time.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Regime Mapping</h2>
        <h3>High-Value Regimes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Deep-space and long-duration missions</li>
          <li>Monotony-heavy operational environments</li>
          <li>Manual interfaces used repeatedly over time</li>
          <li>Contexts where electronic monitoring is undesirable</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Failure Regimes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Short missions or emergency operations</li>
          <li>Tasks requiring precise real-time assessment</li>
          <li>Populations unable to perceive or act on subtle cues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Distinguishing From Confounds</h2>
        <p>
          Valid signaling must arise from intrinsic material response, not from wear,
          contamination, behavioral compliance, instruction, or placebo effects.
          Signals must remain interpretable under real-world variability without
          degrading task performance.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Falsification Criteria</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No correlation between material response and known fatigue markers</li>
          <li>Signals appear too late or too ambiguously to influence behavior</li>
          <li>Effects vanish under operational stress or variability</li>
          <li>Users ignore, misinterpret, or habituate to signals</li>
          <li>Material response interferes with mission safety</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Astronaut-Centered Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Properly designed, these materials may improve self-regulation, reduce
          overconfidence, surface early risk, and support crew safety without stigma
          or surveillance. Risks include misinterpretation, anxiety, or misuse as a
          disciplinary proxy—making ethical framing essential.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Ethical Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No monitoring, scoring, or data extraction</li>
          <li>No use as evaluative or disciplinary tools</li>
          <li>Explicit framing as supportive, not diagnostic</li>
          <li>Transparent communication of limits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Final Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>CONDITIONAL GO.</strong> Intrinsic cognitive-drift signaling materials
          are plausible and potentially high-impact for long-duration missions if
          designed with extreme restraint, robust validation, and strict ethical
          boundaries. They must remain supplemental and human-centered, never
          substituting for primary operational or medical safeguards.
        </p>

        <h2>Invariant Closure (Canonical)</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Symmetry group (𝑮):</strong> Repeated human–material interaction
          transformations (force application, timing, rhythm, use frequency)
          under which interface stability and response are evaluated.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Conserved quantity (𝑸):</strong> Human agency and autonomy.
          No informational extraction, scoring, diagnosis, or authority transfer
          is permitted or conserved across transformations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Invariant spectrum (𝑺):</strong> The irreversible material
          response states encoding cumulative interaction quality
          (hysteresis state, tactile drift, mechanical ratchet position).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Failure signature on 𝑺:</strong> Either (a) absence of
          monotonic, interaction-correlated state evolution, or (b) emergence
          of responses that require interpretation, inference, or institutional
          authority to act upon.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Legitimacy boundary:</strong> Any claim that infers cognitive
          state, diagnoses impairment, enforces compliance, or asserts authority
          beyond passive self-awareness is not legitimate within this regime.
          The material may signal; it may not judge, score, or command.
        </p>
