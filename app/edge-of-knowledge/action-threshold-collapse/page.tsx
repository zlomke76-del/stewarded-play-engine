        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>
          Action Threshold Collapse is frequently misclassified as indecision,
          weakness, or incompetence in governance. This misdiagnosis obscures the
          true mechanism at work. In these cases, paralysis does not arise from
          lack of will, insight, or authority, but from the structural reality
          that every available intervention carries secondary effects perceived
          as more damaging than the risk itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Treating such impasses as moral or managerial failure distorts
          responsibility, undermines legitimate stewardship, and collapses
          ethical evaluation into caricature.
        </p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Action Threshold Collapse is a governance failure mode distinct from
          procedural inertia, omission, or ignorance. It occurs when risk is
          recognized, signaling is clear, and intervention capability exists,
          yet effective action is foreclosed because all available options induce
          unacceptable secondary harm, instability, or legitimacy loss. This
          failure mode emerges in systems where structural tradeoffs render all
          interventions net-negative, producing paralysis, oscillation, or
          delayed escalation. The diagnosis applies only where information is
          sufficient, authority exists, and inaction is compelled by the
          destabilizing consequences of action itself.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem: When Every Action Increases Harm</h2>
        <p>
          In certain tightly coupled systems, intervention initiates adverse
          cascades that amplify rather than reduce risk. Actions trigger feedback
          loops, legitimacy erosion, or secondary failures that exceed the
          original threat. In such regimes, inaction is not a default preference;
          it is the consequence of all available actions being ethically or
          operationally indefensible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system is not ignorant, unprepared, or procedurally stalled. It is
          constrained by the reality that intervention itself becomes the most
          dangerous act.
        </p>

        <h2>Failure Mode Definition</h2>
        <p>
          Action Threshold Collapse applies only when all of the following
          conditions are simultaneously satisfied:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Recognized risk:</strong> The threat is explicitly acknowledged
            by decision-makers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear signaling:</strong> Alerts and feedback mechanisms
            accurately communicate risk magnitude and trajectory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Available capability:</strong> Practical means of intervention
            exist within scope of authority.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Action-induced destabilization:</strong> Every available
            intervention produces secondary harm, legitimacy loss, or instability
            outweighing its benefit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Under these conditions, paralysis, oscillation, or delayed escalation
          is not negligence—it is structurally compelled.
        </p>

        <h2>Distinction From Adjacent Failure Modes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Procedural Entrenchment:</strong> Action is blocked by rigid
            adherence to rules. In Action Threshold Collapse, procedures may be
            flexible, but outcomes remain unacceptable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Neglect or Omission:</strong> Risk is ignored or unrecognized.
            Here, risk and duty are explicitly acknowledged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Silent Degradation:</strong> Harm accumulates without detection.
            In this mode, signaling is sufficient and visible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Late or Absent Warning:</strong> Information arrives too late.
            In Action Threshold Collapse, information is timely and credible.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Regime Mapping</h2>

        <h3>Likely</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Systemic financial crises</li>
          <li>Geopolitical standoffs</li>
          <li>Highly interconnected infrastructure under stress</li>
          <li>Ecological or social systems with strong feedback coupling</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Marginal</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Loosely coupled systems</li>
          <li>Domains where intervention effects can be isolated or contained</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Inapplicable</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ignorance or missing information</li>
          <li>Lack of authority or capability</li>
          <li>Procedural blockage as primary cause</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Signaling Alone Cannot Resolve It</h2>
        <p>
          No increase in monitoring, data, or warning fidelity resolves Action
          Threshold Collapse. The impasse is not epistemic; it is structural and
          ethical. Additional information only sharpens awareness of the dilemma
          without creating a viable path to safe action.
        </p>

        <h2>Falsification Criteria</h2>
        <p>This framing fails if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Comparable systems reliably intervene without producing greater harm
          </li>
          <li>
            Paralysis is shown to result from missing knowledge or capacity
          </li>
          <li>
            Incremental or adaptive actions consistently restore stability
            without unacceptable side effects
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ethical Risk of Misuse</h2>
        <p>
          This concept can be abused to rationalize bad-faith inaction or shield
          actors from accountability. Action Threshold Collapse must never be
          invoked without transparent articulation of tradeoffs, projected
          consequences, and why no available action meets ethical thresholds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without this transparency, the concept collapses into excuse-making.
        </p>

        <h2>Invariant Framework Declaration</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Symmetry group (𝑮):</strong> Permissible governance
            interventions under existing authority, mandate, and legal bounds
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Conserved quantity (𝑸):</strong> System legitimacy and
            stability under intervention
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Invariant spectrum (𝑺):</strong> Net harm induced by each
            available action, measured across coupled domains (stability,
            legitimacy, cascading risk)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Failure signature on 𝑺:</strong> All admissible actions
            occupy a strictly worse harm region than inaction, producing a
            categorical gap rather than a gradient tradeoff
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>CONDITIONAL VALIDITY.</strong> Action Threshold Collapse is a
          distinct and structurally falsifiable governance failure mode arising
          only when action is foreclosed by irreducible harm tradeoffs. It does
          not absolve responsibility; it defines the boundary where legitimacy
          cannot be claimed by action or inaction alone.
