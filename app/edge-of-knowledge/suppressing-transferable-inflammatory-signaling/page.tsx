            A passive polymer architecture that irreversibly suppresses

          </strong>
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>I. Problem Statement</h2>

        <p>
          Modern indoor environments satisfy regulatory air-quality thresholds
          while continuing to produce chronic inflammatory burden across
          populations. This failure persists because prevailing standards focus
          on bulk pollutant concentration rather than the transferable,
          biologically active fractions that directly trigger epithelial,
          immune, and neural inflammatory pathways.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dominant drivers are not mass particulate load or acute toxic
          exposure, but low-level, persistent signaling inputs: endotoxin and
          allergen fragments associated with particulate matter, indoor
          oxidants such as ozone, and reactive aldehydes released through
          material off-gassing. These species remain biologically potent at
          concentrations far below regulatory concern and act continuously
          over years.
        </p>

        <p>
          Existing mitigation strategies—ventilation, filtration, adsorption,
          and episodic cleaning—operate episodically, require energy or
          maintenance, and do not permanently alter baseline exposure.
          Consequently, inflammatory signaling re-establishes immediately
          between interventions.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>II. System Definition</h2>

        <p>
          The proposed system is a microphase-separated, zwitterionic
          block-copolymer textile or surface membrane embedding covalently
          anchored redox-buffer motifs and nucleophilic binding sites within a
          hydrated surface domain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Its function is to passively and continuously suppress indoor
          inflammatory signaling by:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Irreversibly sequestering the transferable bioactive fraction of
            PM-associated endotoxin and allergen fragments;
          </li>
          <li>
            Consuming indoor oxidants through immobilized redox buffering;
          </li>
          <li>
            Neutralizing reactive aldehydes via stable, non-volatile adduct
            formation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All mechanisms operate without leaching, regeneration, external
          energy input, or user action. Bound species are immobilized within the
          polymer matrix and are not re-emitted under humidity, mechanical, or
          cleaning cycles.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>III. Why Endpoint Air Metrics Fail</h2>

        <p>
          Bulk PM concentration, VOC totals, or average ozone levels do not
          correlate reliably with inflammatory response. What matters is the
          fraction that remains transferable to epithelial surfaces and capable
          of engaging innate immune signaling pathways.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two environments with identical measured air concentrations may
          differ dramatically in biological impact depending on the availability
          of transferable endotoxin fragments, oxidant persistence, and local
          humidity-mediated uptake dynamics.
        </p>

        <p>
          Endpoint air measurements therefore cannot validate biological safety.
          Any credible intervention must operate at the level of signaling
          suppression, not mass reduction alone.
        </p>

        <h2>IV. Polymer Architecture and Governing Mechanisms</h2>

        <h3>Architecture</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Zwitterionic surface domains provide high hydration, suppress
            nonspecific fouling, and stabilize humidity at the interface;
          </li>
          <li>
            Nanostructured ionic and gel microcavities immobilize bioactive
            endotoxin and allergen fragments through dual electrostatic and
            physical trapping;
          </li>
          <li>
            Covalently tethered redox-buffer motifs convert indoor oxidants to
            stable, non-volatile oxidized states;
          </li>
          <li>
            Immobilized nucleophilic sites form irreversible adducts with
            reactive aldehydes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Functional layer thickness exceeds the maximum diffusion length of
          target species during humidity cycling, preventing early breakthrough
          or re-release.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>V. Internal State Vector and MTI-1 Compliance</h2>

        <p>
          System validity is governed by an explicit internal state trajectory,
          not by endpoint performance claims. The minimal observable state
          vector includes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Surface hydration (contact angle or gravimetric uptake);</li>
          <li>Surface ionic conductivity (impedance spectroscopy);</li>
          <li>Redox capacity (catechol–quinone ratio or equivalent);</li>
          <li>
            Bound bioactive fragment load (extractable endotoxin/allergen
            assay).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These variables evolve monotonically with exposure and cycling.
          Sequence dependence is expected: oxidant exposure followed by
          mechanical flex produces a different trajectory than flexing prior
          to oxidant exposure. Endpoint equivalence does not imply trajectory
          equivalence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Durability and efficacy claims are valid only within the bounded
          regime defined by these trajectories, in accordance with Morphology
          Trajectory Integrity (MTI-1).
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VI. Regime Boundaries</h2>

        <h3>Applies to</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Interior occupied environments with relative humidity between
            30–65%;
          </li>
          <li>
            Formaldehyde and aldehyde concentrations in the 10–500 ppb range;
          </li>
          <li>
            Continuous, low-level oxidant exposure typical of urban indoor
            spaces;
          </li>
          <li>
            Deployment on soft surfaces, textiles, wall panels, bedding, and
            furnishings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Does not apply to</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Outdoor or industrial atmospheres;</li>
          <li>Environments with extreme humidity (&lt;20% or &gt;80% RH);</li>
          <li>
            Chemical regimes involving solvents, strong acids, or bases that
            degrade the polymer;
          </li>
          <li>Claims of universal air purification.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>VII. Decisive Falsification Test</h2>

        <p>
          The system is falsified if, under controlled indoor chamber exposure
          to realistic PM-associated bioactive fragments, ozone, and reactive
          aldehydes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            No persistent reduction in transferable endotoxin or allergen
            fraction is observed;
          </li>
          <li>
            Bound species are measurably re-released under humidity or cleaning
            cycles;
          </li>
          <li>
            Oxidant or aldehyde conversion produces volatile or hazardous
            byproducts above ambient baseline;
          </li>
          <li>
            Internal state vector trajectories do not correlate with exposure
            history.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Failure under any of these conditions irreversibly invalidates the
          system’s claims within this regime.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VIII. Humanity-Scale Impact</h2>

        <p>
          This system does not rely on behavior, awareness, or episodic
          intervention. It alters the environmental baseline itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          By converting ubiquitous indoor surfaces into continuous suppressors
          of inflammatory signaling, it reduces chronic immune activation across
          entire populations—especially children, the elderly, and the
          chronically exposed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The impact is cumulative, silent, and systemic: a background reduction
          in inflammation that conventional filtration, ventilation, and policy
          interventions cannot achieve.
        </p>
