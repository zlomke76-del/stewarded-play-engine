            A governing materials architecture in which operational energy
            gradients irreversibly increase internal structural order rather

        <h2>I. Doctrine Statement</h2>

        <p>
          In composite systems exposed to sustained mechanical, thermal, or
          vibrational gradients below melting or catastrophic failure
          thresholds, durability claims are valid only if internal structural
          evolution is explicitly tracked as a function of exposure trajectory.
          Where internal interfaces undergo irreversible, gradient-driven
          reconfiguration, endpoint-equivalent treatments cannot reproduce the
          resulting material state.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Irreversible Gradient-Ratcheting Composites (IGRC)</em> define a
          class of architectures in which environmental gradients act not merely
          as degradation drivers, but as directional selectors that permanently
          bias interfacial topology, alignment order, and load transfer pathways.
          Structural improvement, if present, is conditional on history and is
          not inferable from endpoint properties alone.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>II. Architectural Scope (What IGRC Is)</h2>

        <p>
          IGRC describes composite architectures that satisfy all of the
          following conditions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A semi-crystalline or partially ordered polymer matrix capable of
            localized microstructural rearrangement without melting
          </li>
          <li>
            A mechanically anisotropic secondary phase that concentrates stress
            and thermal gradients at the interface
          </li>
          <li>
            Covalently tethered, mechanochemically active interfacial linkages
            that undergo irreversible bond rupture and re-formation under
            super-threshold gradients
          </li>
          <li>
            No reversible, supramolecular, self-healing, electronic, or
            externally actuated mechanisms
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The defining feature is not material composition, but the existence
          of an irreversible, gradient-activated interfacial ratchet that
          accumulates directional order over service exposure.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>III. Governing Mechanism (Physics, Not Outcome)</h2>

        <p>
          IGRC exploits localized interfacial instability rather than bulk phase
          transformation. Differential thermal expansion, cyclic strain, or
          sustained pressure gradients amplify stress at the polymer–secondary
          phase boundary. When a critical threshold is exceeded:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Mechanophoric interfacial bonds rupture at localized sites</li>
          <li>
            Latent reactive groups are exposed and irreversibly re-bond in a new
            topology
          </li>
          <li>
            Polymer chains adjacent to the interface re-align and become
            topologically trapped
          </li>
          <li>
            Reverse reactions are thermodynamically and kinetically forbidden
            under service conditions
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each activation event reduces local configurational entropy while
          global entropy increases through heat dissipation and chemical bond
          formation, satisfying the second law for the system plus environment.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>IV. MTI-1 State Vector (Required)</h2>

        <p>
          Any claim of IGRC behavior requires explicit tracking of a minimum
          internal state vector:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>ψ<sub>if</sub></strong> — density of irreversibly transitioned
            interfacial bonds (direction-resolved)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Φ<sub>al</sub></strong> — alignment order parameter of the
            secondary phase
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Λ<sub>cr</sub></strong> — fraction of low-defect,
            high-alignment crystalline or ordered matrix domains
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These variables must evolve monotonically and path-dependently under
          gradient exposure. Endpoint measurements of modulus, strength, or
          crystallinity alone are insufficient and invalid for trajectory-based
          claims.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>V. Non-Commutativity as the Integrity Test</h2>

        <p>
          IGRC architectures are intrinsically non-commutative. Identical
          endpoint conditions reached via different exposure sequences do not
          yield equivalent internal states.
        </p>

        <p>
          If endpoint treatments reproduce the same internal state, the system
          does not qualify as IGRC.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VI. Earliest Failure Mode (Architectural Truth)</h2>

        <p>
          If the IGRC architecture is invalid, failure manifests first at the
          polymer–secondary phase interface.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VII. Single Decisive Falsification Test</h2>

        <p>
          A standardized composite coupon is subjected to directional gradients
          and mechanical cycling. The system fails if ratcheted internal state
          variables do not evolve irreversibly or are reproducible by endpoint
          treatments.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VIII. Regime Boundaries</h2>

        <p>
          Applies only where persistent gradients dominate lifetime behavior.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>IX. Edge of Knowledge Judgment</h2>

        <p>
          IGRC asserts that when irreversible, gradient-driven interfacial
          evolution is physically present, durability claims must be
          trajectory-accounted or considered structurally invalid.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Invariant Closure (Canonical)</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Symmetry group (𝑮):</strong> Gradient-preserving exposure
          transformations (thermal, mechanical, vibrational) under which
          internal structure evolves.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Conserved quantity (𝑸):</strong> Total material mass and
          chemical inventory. No energy gain, healing, or reversible ordering
          is conserved across transformations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Invariant spectrum (𝑺):</strong> The set of irreversible
          internal state variables {"{"}ψ<sub>if</sub>, Φ<sub>al</sub>, Λ<sub>cr</sub>{"}"}
          encoding gradient history.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Failure signature on 𝑺:</strong> Either (a) absence of
          monotonic, path-dependent evolution, or (b) reproducibility of the
          same spectrum through endpoint-only treatments.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Legitimacy boundary:</strong> Any durability, improvement, or
          safety claim not explicitly grounded in the invariant spectrum is not
          legitimate within this regime and must be rejected.
        </p>
