        <h2>1. Problem Framing</h2>
        <p>
          IIEM addresses a recurring governance and safety failure: cumulative,
          hazard-driven exposure of infrastructure components is often not
          reliably recorded, preserved, or made visible using existing regimes.
          Inspection gaps, lost records, sensor failures, administrative neglect,
          and data manipulation can allow critical exposure thresholds to be
          crossed without durable acknowledgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          IIEM encodes—by irreversible physical change—the fact that a defined
          exposure boundary has been crossed. The record is co-located with the
          asset, independent of electronics, institutional memory, or digital
          systems.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Physical and Material Plausibility</h2>
        <p>
          Passive, irreversible exposure encoding is physically plausible using
          known materials such as UV-dose films, stress-indicating lacquers,
          corrosion-promoted patinas, or chemically gated color-change pastes.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calibration to cumulative, not instantaneous, exposure</li>
          <li>Irreversibility under operational conditions</li>
          <li>Resistance to tampering, fading, or detachment</li>
          <li>Visibility under realistic inspection environments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Failure modes include premature activation, missed threshold crossing,
          cross-sensitivity, concealment, or physical loss of the marker.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Regime Mapping</h2>

        <h3>Viable</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Assets exposed to dominant, predictable hazards</li>
          <li>Contexts with inspection gaps or unreliable records</li>
          <li>Situations where post-exposure accountability matters</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Degrades</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Routine repainting or surface replacement</li>
          <li>Multiple confounding exposure mechanisms</li>
          <li>Institutional cultures that ignore physical indicators</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fails</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Inaccessible or concealed components</li>
          <li>Highly variable or poorly characterizable exposure regimes</li>
          <li>Use as a substitute for inspection or maintenance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Distinction From Confounds</h2>
        <p>IIEM is not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A sensor or monitoring system</li>
          <li>Predictive maintenance or failure forecasting</li>
          <li>A warning or alert mechanism</li>
          <li>A performance-enhancing material</li>
          <li>A digital or administrative logging system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It records past exposure only. It does not predict failure or guarantee
          safety.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Falsification Criteria</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            No material reliably produces irreversible, interpretable change at
            the intended exposure threshold
          </li>
          <li>False positives or negatives dominate real-world behavior</li>
          <li>Markers are routinely lost, obscured, or altered</li>
          <li>
            Institutional regimes ignore or misuse the encoded information
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Ethical Risk of Misuse</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Responsibility shifting onto the marker instead of stewardship
          </li>
          <li>False inference of safety from lack of visible change</li>
          <li>
            Weaponization for blame, liability avoidance, or cost deferral
          </li>
          <li>Misrepresentation as a safety or early-warning system</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Final Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>CONDITIONAL GO</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          IIEM is physically plausible and occupies a unique role as a passive,
          persistent exposure record. Its value lies in auditability and
          accountability, not prediction or prevention. Deployment is justified
          only in tightly governed trials with explicit guardrails preventing
          misuse or substitution for inspection.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Invariant Closure (Canonical)</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Symmetry group (𝑮):</strong> Exposure-preserving transformations
          of the infrastructure environment (time, duty cycle, hazard intensity)
          under which inspection records and administrative representations may
          vary.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Conserved quantity (𝑸):</strong> Total cumulative exposure to
          the targeted hazard class. Exposure may be distributed or unrecorded,
          but it is not negated by documentation, repainting, or administrative
          action.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Invariant spectrum (𝑺):</strong> The irreversible physical state
          of the marker encoding threshold-crossing exposure (e.g., color change,
          phase transition, morphology shift).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Failure signature on 𝑺:</strong> Either (a) absence of
          irreversible change after verified threshold exposure, or (b)
          irreversible change occurring outside the defined exposure regime.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Legitimacy boundary:</strong> Any claim of compliance, safety,
          or stewardship that contradicts the marker’s invariant state is not
          legitimate by formal or ethical criteria and must be rejected.
        </p>
