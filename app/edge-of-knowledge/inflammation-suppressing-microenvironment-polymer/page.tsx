          <strong>
            A passive polymer system that lowers baseline human inflammatory load
            by permanently neutralizing transferable airborne bioactive drivers
            within indoor environments
          </strong>

        <h2>I. System Definition</h2>

        <p>
          This system is a microphase-separated, zwitterionic block-copolymer
          textile surface embedding covalently anchored redox-buffer motifs and
          nucleophilic binding sites for continuous sequestration of the
          transferable bioactive fraction of particulate-associated
          endotoxin/allergen fragments, consumption of indoor oxidants, and
          neutralization of reactive aldehydes, with no re-emission or hazardous
          byproducts under real indoor cycling.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system operates passively, without airflow forcing, regeneration,
          external energy input, antimicrobial activity, or user behavior. Its
          function is to lower the chronic inflammatory background of indoor
          human micro-environments by permanently removing specific biochemical
          triggers from circulation.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>II. Targeted Inflammation Drivers</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Transferable bioactive PM fractions:</strong> endotoxin and
            allergen fragments associated with particulate matter that activate
            epithelial and innate immune pathways independent of bulk particle
            mass.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Indoor oxidants:</strong> ozone and secondary oxidants that
            generate oxidative stress and epithelial injury.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reactive aldehydes:</strong> small electrophilic VOCs (e.g.,
            formaldehyde) that form protein adducts and irritate airway and
            neural tissues.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Bulk particulate filtration, antimicrobial killing, and universal VOC
          capture are explicitly outside scope. Only transferable bioactive and
          chemically reactive drivers are claimed.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>III. Governing Polymer Mechanisms</h2>

        <h3>Bioactive Fragment Sequestration</h3>
        <p>
          Target fragments are captured by a dual-mode architecture: high-affinity
          ionic and zwitterionic sites immobilize fragments electrostatically,
          followed by physical entrapment within hydrated gel microcavities.
          This suppresses transfer, shedding, and re-aerosolization under
          physiologically relevant humidity, handling, and cleaning.
        </p>

        <h3>Oxidant Consumption</h3>
        <p>
          Indoor oxidants are consumed by immobilized redox-buffer motifs that
          irreversibly transition to a stable oxidized state. No catalytic
          regeneration is claimed, and no volatile carbonyl or secondary
          byproducts are produced above ambient baseline.
        </p>

        <h3>Reactive Aldehyde Neutralization</h3>
        <p>
          Reactive aldehydes are neutralized by covalently anchored nucleophilic
          sites, forming stable, non-volatile adducts retained within the
          polymer matrix. Non-reactive VOCs are not claimed.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>IV. Polymer Architecture</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Base:</strong> polyether-based block copolymer incorporating
            zwitterionic sulfobetaine segments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functional domains:</strong> covalently immobilized
            catechol-like redox motifs and nucleophilic capture sites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Morphology:</strong> hydrated surface region containing
            nanodomains (20–50 nm) within a functional layer thickness exceeding
            diffusion lengths of targeted species under service cycling.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The architecture prevents functional group migration, blooming,
          leaching, or surface depletion during use.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>V. Internal State Vector (MTI-1)</h2>

        <p>
          System integrity is governed by a minimal, observable state vector:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Surface hydration (contact angle or gravimetric uptake)</li>
          <li>Surface ionic conductivity (impedance spectroscopy)</li>
          <li>
            Redox capacity index (quinone:catechol ratio or equivalent spectral
            proxy)
          </li>
          <li>
            Bound bioactive fragment load (surface extract assay, e.g., LAL or
            ELISA)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These parameters evolve monotonically under exposure and define both
          functional capacity and end-of-life conditions.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VI. Failure Physics and Silent Killers</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Saturation:</strong> redox and ionic signals plateau while
            breakthrough appears in air metrics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fouling:</strong> surface hydration decreases, permeability
            drops.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plasticization:</strong> swelling &gt;5% with domain
            broadening.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Migration:</strong> any detectable extractables in wash or
            wipe fluids.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Humidity drift:</strong> irreversible conductivity loss
            across cycles.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>VII. Decisive Falsification Test</h2>

        <p>
          Standardized textile panels are chamber-exposed to real-world indoor
          PM, ozone, and aldehydes under humidity cycling and cleaning stress.
        </p>

        <p>
          The claim fails if any targeted driver shows insufficient reduction,
          early breakthrough, re-release under challenge, or formation of
          hazardous byproducts above ambient baseline.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VIII. First Deployment Wedge</h2>

        <p>
          Hospital rooms represent the highest-value initial deployment:
          vulnerable populations, elevated irritant loads, frequent cleaning,
          and institutional capacity for controlled replacement cycles.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>IX. Humanity-Scale Significance</h2>

        <p>
          This system alters the baseline inflammatory ecology of indoor human
          environments continuously and passively. By lowering chronic immune
          activation without behavior change, it enables cumulative health
          protection across sleep, work, recovery, and care settings—an effect
          unreachable by filters, ventilation, or episodic interventions.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>X. Invariant Closure (Canonical)</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Symmetry group (𝑮):</strong> Indoor environmental cycling
          transformations (humidity, occupancy, cleaning, airflow fluctuations)
          under which system legitimacy is claimed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Conserved quantity (𝑸):</strong> Total chemically active
          inflammatory driver load within the micro-environment (oxidant
          equivalents + transferable bioactive fragment potential).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Invariant spectrum (𝑺):</strong> The measurable set of
          irreducible chemical states retained or neutralized by the polymer:
          bound endotoxin/allergen fragment load, consumed oxidant capacity, and
          aldehyde adduct population—observable via MTI-1 state variables.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Failure signature on 𝑺:</strong> Re-emergence, transfer, or
          regeneration of any targeted inflammatory driver despite unchanged
          conserved totals elsewhere in the room; or loss of monotonicity in the
          MTI-1 vector.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Disentitlement:</strong> Any claim of inflammation suppression,
          health benefit, or environmental control that does not map directly to
          persistence and monotonic evolution of 𝑺 is illegitimate. Bulk air
          metrics, proxy comfort indicators, or subjective outcomes cannot
          substitute for invariant-state verification.
        </p>
