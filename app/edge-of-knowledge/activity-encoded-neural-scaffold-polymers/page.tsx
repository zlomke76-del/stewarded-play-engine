            A material class that irreversibly records neural activity history
            through scaffold-level architectural change rather than biochemical
            signaling

        <h2>I. Scope and Boundary Condition</h2>

        <p>
          This paper defines a class of stimulus-responsive polymer scaffolds in
          which neural activity induces irreversible, nanoscale conformational
          transitions in the material architecture itself. These transitions
          persist independently of chemical composition, bulk mechanical
          properties, or subsequent endpoint measurements.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system does not claim clinical deployment, therapeutic efficacy,
          cognitive enhancement, or direct intervention in intact human nervous
          systems. All claims are bounded to engineered neural constructs, in
          vitro systems, and experimental regenerative platforms where material
          architecture acts as a governing constraint on plasticity.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>II. The Unaddressed Constraint in Neural Engineering</h2>

        <p>
          Current neural scaffolds—biological, synthetic, or hybrid—are treated
          as passive substrates whose role is limited to biochemical signaling,
          permissive support, or transient mechanical compliance. They do not
          encode or retain a record of neural activity as a persistent material
          state.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, endpoint equivalence in scaffold chemistry or modulus is
          routinely assumed to imply functional equivalence, despite divergent
          developmental or stimulation histories. This assumption is
          structurally invalid wherever scaffold architecture constrains synaptic
          organization and plasticity over time.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>III. Polymer Architecture (Function, Not Composition)</h2>

        <p>
          The system consists of a permanently crosslinked, amphiphilic block
          copolymer hydrogel organized as a three-dimensional neural scaffold.
          Embedded within the network are bistable, mechanophoric crosslinkers or
          mesh segments capable of transitioning between discrete conformational
          states.
        </p>

        <p>
          These states differ in nanoscale geometry—mesh size, anisotropy, and
          constraint topology—rather than chemical identity. Transitions occur
          only when local electro-mechanical activity at the neuron–material
          interface exceeds defined physiological thresholds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside this bounded activity envelope, the scaffold remains inert and
          non-transitioning.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>IV. Governing Physics: Material-Encoded History</h2>

        <p>
          When exposed to suprathreshold, patterned neural activity, localized
          regions of the scaffold undergo irreversible conformational shifts.
          These shifts alter the physical constraints governing synaptic
          spacing, connectivity, and remodeling potential.
        </p>

        <p>
          The resulting architecture reflects the sequence, intensity, and
          distribution of prior activity. Because the transitions are
          non-commutative, endpoint-equivalent scaffolds produced through
          different activity histories are not physically interchangeable.
        </p>

        <p>
          This establishes scaffold architecture as a trajectory-dependent state
          variable rather than a static background property.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>V. Why Endpoint Properties Fail</h2>

        <p>
          Bulk measurements—elastic modulus, swelling ratio, conductivity, or
          chemical composition—cannot reconstruct the specific activity history
          that produced a given scaffold architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two scaffolds may be indistinguishable by all endpoint metrics while
          enforcing fundamentally different constraint geometries on neural
          circuits. Any claim of equivalence based solely on endpoint testing is
          therefore structurally unsound in this regime.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VI. Irreversible State Vector</h2>

        <p>
          The irreducible state vector governing this system includes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Local crosslinker conformation state</li>
          <li>Mesh geometry and anisotropy distribution</li>
          <li>Spatial constraint topology imposed on synaptic regions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This vector evolves irreversibly once activity thresholds are crossed
          and cannot be reset without physical destruction or replacement of the
          scaffold.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VII. Single Decisive Falsification Test</h2>

        <p>
          Neural networks or organoids grown within the scaffold are subjected to
          suprathreshold patterned stimulation and compared to subthreshold or
          inactive controls.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system is falsified if:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            No irreversible, activity-correlated change in scaffold geometry is
            observed
          </li>
          <li>
            Distinct activity sequences produce endpoint-equivalent and
            architecturally indistinguishable scaffolds
          </li>
          <li>
            Transitions occur outside the defined physiological activity envelope
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

          <li>Any context lacking sustained neural activity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IX. Invariant Framework Declaration</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Symmetry group (𝑮):</strong> Reparameterizations of scaffold
          composition, bulk mechanical properties, and measurement basis that
          preserve overall material identity but permit arbitrary relabeling of
          endpoint descriptors.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Conserved quantity (𝑸):</strong> Total scaffold connectivity
          and crosslink continuity; no polymer backbone or network bonds are
          created or destroyed during activity encoding.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Invariant spectrum (𝑺):</strong> The spatial distribution of
          irreversible conformational states across the scaffold network,
          corresponding to the set of activity-induced architectural constraints
          imposed on neural growth and remodeling.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Failure signature on 𝑺:</strong> Two scaffolds exhibiting
          identical endpoint properties but non-identical invariant spectra,
          demonstrating that activity history is physically encoded and cannot
          be transformed away by any permitted symmetry operation.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>X. Edge of Knowledge Judgment</h2>

        <p>
          This system does not propose enhancement, therapy, or intervention. It
          establishes a governing constraint: where material architecture
          irreversibly encodes activity history, endpoint equivalence is
          epistemically invalid.
        </p>

        <p>
          By relocating memory from biochemical signaling to physical scaffold
          geometry, this material class defines a hard boundary for neural
          engineering claims and closes a longstanding gap between developmental
          history and material qualification.
