        <h2>Abstract (Regulatory-Safe)</h2>

        <p>
          This paper delineates a class of passive surface polymers, designed
          specifically for infrastructure applications, whose function is to
          irreversibly eliminate surface-mediated pathways for secondary human
          exposure to persistent organophosphate residues. The system acts
          exclusively at the surface–contact interface, converting trace,
          surface-bound organophosphate compounds into non-bioavailable,
          covalently immobilized fragments. The polymer does not remediate
          environmental sources, emit volatile byproducts, or affect upstream
          compound usage. All claims are strictly bounded to pathway interruption
          under real-world environmental cycling and are explicitly falsifiable
          by surface-state and residue bioactivity testing.
        </p>

        <h2>I. Scope and Non-Claims (Critical Boundary)</h2>

        <p>This system does <strong>not</strong>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Remediate or decontaminate soil, water, crops, or ecosystems</li>
          <li>Alter environmental transport, fate, or concentration of organophosphates</li>
          <li>Enable, justify, or legitimize pesticide or neurotoxin deployment</li>
          <li>Claim population-scale neurological or health outcome improvement</li>
          <li>Act as a catalyst that releases mobile or volatile reaction products</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This system <strong>only</strong>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Interrupts surface-mediated secondary transfer of pre-existing trace
            residues
          </li>
          <li>
            Operates passively without energy input, maintenance, or user action
          </li>
          <li>
            Produces no volatile, extractable, mobile, or bioavailable species
            during service
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All interpretations must respect this strict structural distinction.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>II. Targeted Harm Pathway (Not Environmental Load)</h2>

        <p>
          This work addresses the secondary exposure route arising from the
          accumulation and transfer of trace organophosphate residues on built
          surfaces. These residues persist through sorption, mechanical contact,
          runoff, and aerosol resuspension, enabling repeated low-dose human
          re-exposure that is disproportionate to original environmental
          concentrations and largely ungoverned by conventional regulation.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>III. Polymer Architecture (Function, Not Composition)</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Permanently crosslinked surface polymer engineered for infrastructure
            durability
          </li>
          <li>
            Covalently tethered, spatially confined phosphotriesterase-mimetic
            domains localized to the interface layer
          </li>
          <li>
            Inert structural backbone consistent with polyolefin or
            polyurethane-class behavior
          </li>
          <li>
            No mobile catalysts, additives, scavengers, or leachable components
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          No chemical identities, synthesis routes, or optimization strategies
          are disclosed or implied.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>IV. Governing Mechanism (Irreversible, Non-Emissive)</h2>

        <p>
          Under alternating real-world exposure to oxidants, ambient moisture,
          and mechanical or aqueous stress:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Surface-bound organophosphate residues contact immobilized catalytic
            domains
          </li>
          <li>
            Residues undergo irreversible hydrolytic cleavage at the interface
          </li>
          <li>
            Cleavage fragments are covalently immobilized within the polymer
            network
          </li>
          <li>
            Bioactivity is permanently eliminated and cannot be restored without
            physical destruction of the matrix
          </li>
          <li>
            No volatile, extractable, or mobile products are generated
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The system does not regenerate, turnover, or emit reaction products.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>V. Why Existing Materials Fail (Structural)</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Adsorptive surfaces allow reversible release and re-transfer</li>
          <li>Conventional coatings lack irreversible chemical neutralization</li>
          <li>
            Active remediation requires energy, maintenance, and regulatory
            intervention
          </li>
          <li>
            Endpoint inspection cannot distinguish latent bioactivity from true
            neutralization
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This system enforces an irreversible surface-state transition that
          invalidates false clearance claims.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VI. Observable, Non-Proprietary State Change</h2>

        <p>
          After appropriate exposure sequencing, the following must be
          observable:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Loss of parent organophosphate signature (IR/XPS/NMR)
          </li>
          <li>
            Presence of covalently immobilized hydrolysis fragments
          </li>
          <li>
            Null bioactivity confirmed by validated inhibition assays after
            extraction
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Verification does not require access to proprietary information.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>VII. Decisive Falsification (Kill Test)</h2>

        <p>The system fails if, after full exposure cycling:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            &gt;1% recoverable, bioactive organophosphate remains
          </li>
          <li>
            Volatile or extractable products exceed ambient baselines
          </li>
          <li>
            No irreversible surface-state transition is detected
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>VIII. Regime Boundaries</h2>

        <h3>Applies to</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Exterior infrastructure and transport surfaces</li>
          <li>
            Environments with realistic oxidant, moisture, and mechanical cycling
          </li>
          <li>Passive, maintenance-free deployment contexts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Does not apply to</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Indoor air purification or acute poisoning scenarios</li>
          <li>Soil, water, crop, or food remediation</li>
          <li>
            Environments lacking required environmental triggers
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>IX. End-of-Life and Liability Containment</h2>

        <p>
          At end of service, the material remains inert and non-leaching.
          Regeneration, if pursued, is permitted only under controlled off-site
          conditions. No field reactivation is implied or allowed.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>X. Edge of Knowledge Judgment</h2>

        <p>
          This framework establishes a minimum, enforceable boundary condition
          under which infrastructure surfaces cannot silently harbor or transfer
          neurotoxic residues while remaining claim-eligible. It is not a
          remediation strategy, a performance guarantee, or a health outcome
          claim—only a physically governed interruption of a previously
          untracked exposure pathway.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          Edge of Knowledge documents define governing constraints, not products
          or prescriptions. This paper remains valid until regulatory,
          environmental, or failure boundaries materially change.
