            A doctrine establishing morphology trajectory as a governing
            constraint on durability, invalidating endpoint-only claims in
            trajectory-sensitive polymer regimes.

        <h2>Thesis</h2>

        <p>
          Polymer durability under cyclic mechanical and environmental loading
          is governed not by static material properties or endpoint test
          outcomes, but by the explicit path taken through an observable,
          evolving morphology state space. In regimes where internal morphology
          evolves on service-relevant time and length scales, durability claims
          are structurally invalid unless the morphology trajectory itself is
          explicitly tracked, bounded, and shown to remain within validated
          limits.
        </p>

        <p>
          This doctrine formalizes morphology trajectory as a first-class
          epistemic variable. It does not propose a new material, chemistry, or
          optimization pathway. It establishes a governance constraint that
          reality already enforces but qualification systems routinely ignore.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope and Applicability</h2>

        <h3>Applies To</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Glassy amorphous polymers (e.g., polycarbonate, polystyrene)</li>
          <li>
            Semicrystalline thermoplastics (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene,
            nylon)
          </li>
          <li>
            Supramolecular, multiphase, or physically crosslinked systems
            (ionomers, block copolymers, filled elastomers)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Does Not Apply To</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Inorganics or metallic glasses without functional morphology</li>
          <li>
            Fully crystalline polymers with no service-scale morphology
            evolution
          </li>
          <li>
            Chemistry-dominated degradation regimes where morphology is
            irrelevant (e.g., radiation-driven scission)
          </li>
          <li>
            Single-use, monotonic-load systems explicitly bounded as
            order-invariant
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Outside these regimes, morphology trajectory governance is not
          triggered. Inside them, compliance is mandatory.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Minimal Observable Morphology Trajectory (MOMT)</h2>

        <p>
          Any durability, lifetime, fatigue, creep, or environmental resistance
          claim in a trajectory-sensitive regime must define and track a
          <strong> Minimal Observable Morphology Trajectory</strong>. This
          trajectory consists of at least three orthogonal, directly observable
          morphology parameters appropriate to the polymer family.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Glassy Amorphous Polymers</h3>
        <p>Acceptable observables (any three minimum):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Free volume proxy (density, PALS, equivalent)</li>
          <li>Nanocraze or nanodefect density</li>
          <li>Residual stress field</li>
          <li>Physical aging index (enthalpy relaxation via DSC)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Acceptable trajectories are continuous and monotonic within
          characterized reversible ranges. Untracked relaxation or aging
          invalidates claims.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Semicrystalline Polymers</h3>
        <p>Acceptable observables (any three minimum):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Degree of crystallinity</li>
          <li>Crystal domain size or distribution</li>
          <li>Amorphous phase fraction</li>
          <li>Tie-molecule density proxy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Morphology evolution must remain confined to predefined reversible
          annealing or aging pathways. Gradient collapse or uncharacterized
          recrystallization invalidates claims.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Supramolecular and Multiphase Systems</h3>
        <p>Acceptable observables (any three minimum):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Domain size distribution</li>
          <li>Phase connectivity or percolation state</li>
          <li>Interfacial curvature or tension proxy</li>
          <li>Interfacial cohesion proxy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Domain evolution must be reversible under prescribed cycling.
          Unidirectional coarsening, percolation archiving, or interface
          degradation constitutes irreversible trajectory failure.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Trajectory Continuity Requirement</h2>

        <p>
          Durability claims must reference a continuous morphology trajectory,
          not merely initial and final states. Missing intervals, interpolated
          assumptions, or endpoint-only snapshots constitute a structural
          trajectory break and invalidate the claim.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Non-Commutativity Declaration</h2>

        <p>
          When both mechanical and environmental loads apply, claims must either
          demonstrate order invariance or explicitly test non-commutative load
          sequences (e.g., environment-then-mechanics versus
          mechanics-then-environment). Silence on order effects is treated as
          non-compliance.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Irreversible Loss of Claim Eligibility</h2>

        <p>
          A system irreversibly loses claim eligibility if any monitored
          morphology parameter:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Crosses a characterized non-recoverable threshold</li>
          <li>
            Exhibits path-dependent drift that cannot be reset by permitted
            processes
          </li>
          <li>
            No longer maps to any validated morphology state correlated with
            performance
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Once violated, prior certifications are void. Reuse, equivalence, or
          extension claims are forbidden without full requalification.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Falsifiability Requirement</h2>

        <p>
          Every claim must include at least one explicit kill condition—an
          observable morphology threshold beyond which the claim fails. Claims
          without falsifiability conditions are non-scientific and invalid under
          this doctrine.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Why This Doctrine Exists</h2>

        <p>
          The physical quantity systematically excluded from polymer durability
          qualification is the evolving, spatially heterogeneous distribution
          of internal configurational energy states—free volume, entanglement
          stress, interfacial cohesion, and defect populations—and its
          irreversible redistribution under coupled load and environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Endpoint tests collapse this field into scalar averages, masking the
          trajectory that actually governs failure. This doctrine does not add a
          new variable; it forces explicit accounting for a quantity that has
          always controlled outcome but has never been governed.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Edge of Knowledge Judgment</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>GO.</strong> This doctrine is structurally complete,
          falsifiable, and regime-bounded. It does not claim predictive
          universality, nor does it prescribe material solutions. It elevates
          the epistemic standard required to honestly assert durability in
          systems where morphology evolves.
