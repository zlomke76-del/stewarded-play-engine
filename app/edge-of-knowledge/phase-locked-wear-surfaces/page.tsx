        <h2>1. Problem Framing</h2>

        <p>
          This concept addresses failures of accountability and recordkeeping in
          maintenance regimes. It targets environments where inspection reports,
          sensing systems, and digital logs can be forged, lost, deferred, or
          ignored—allowing improper or skipped maintenance to persist without
          detection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Phase-Locked Wear Surfaces propose a non-reversible, physically encoded
          trace of maintenance sequence and adherence. Stewardship
          responsibility is embedded directly into the object itself, rather
          than into documentation, administrative processes, or monitoring
          infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Physical and Material Plausibility</h2>

        <p>
          It is physically plausible to engineer contact surfaces whose wear
          characteristics reveal servicing history, provided materials and
          geometries are selected to produce controlled, non-reversible wear.
          Correct maintenance yields regular, predictable, phase-aligned wear.
          Deviations—neglect, improper sequencing, or skipped actions—manifest
          as anomalous, asymmetric, or accelerated wear patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
          These patterns function as tamper-evident physical records. Once
          divergence occurs, the wear state cannot be reset or reconciled
          without component replacement.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Material selection:</strong> Surfaces must resist catastrophic
            failure while reliably evolving under both correct and incorrect
            servicing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Calibration:</strong> Acceptable maintenance sequences must
            be explicitly defined prior to deployment; post-hoc interpretation
            undermines validity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Durability:</strong> Wear signatures must remain legible
            across the component’s useful service life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Permanence:</strong> Wear is irreversible; records cannot be
            erased, replayed, or repaired once divergence occurs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Failure modes include environmental confounds (contamination,
          corrosion), unintended wear, premature component retirement, or
          misinterpretation of patterns.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Regime Mapping</h2>

        <h3>Viable</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Safety-critical components where maintenance discipline is paramount
            and external recordkeeping is unreliable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Systems with direct physical access for inspection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Applications where asymmetric or excessive wear appropriately
            triggers replacement or review.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Degrades</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Environments with heavy contamination, corrosion, or uncontrolled
            mechanical variables that obscure wear patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contexts lacking standardized interpretation or trained inspectors.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fails Outright</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Disposable, low-value, or inaccessible components.</li>
          <li>
            Systems with highly variable or unpredictable wear regimes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintenance tasks that do not manifest as physical surface
            interaction.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Distinction From Confounds</h2>

        <p>Phase-Locked Wear Surfaces are not:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sensors or sensing systems</li>
          <li>Monitoring or logging infrastructure</li>
          <li>Predictive diagnostics or forecasting tools</li>
          <li>Lifetime or age indicators</li>
          <li>Performance or safety enhancements</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Evidence is strictly retrospective. The system does not warn, predict,
          or intervene. Misconception risk is significant if interpreted as a
          failure-prevention or compliance system.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Falsification Criteria</h2>

        <p>The concept is invalidated if:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Wear patterns are ambiguous between correct and incorrect
            maintenance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Environmental or operational confounds produce indistinguishable
            signatures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pattern legibility is lost prior to component end-of-life.
          </li>
          <li>
            Engineered wear causes unpredictable or catastrophic failure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Surfaces can be altered, repaired, or spoofed to erase evidence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Independent observers cannot reliably classify wear states above
            chance without privileged context.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Ethical Risk of Misuse</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Responsibility shifting:</strong> Operators may attribute
            failures to “normal wear,” obscuring neglect.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overconfidence:</strong> Visible wear may be misread as proof
            of diligence or safety.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Weaponization:</strong> Patterns could be used in punitive or
            legal actions without adequate contextual safeguards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Misrepresentation:</strong> Marketing as a compliance,
            monitoring, or warning system undermines clarity and ethics.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Final Judgment</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>CONDITIONAL GO</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Phase-Locked Wear Surfaces are physically and materially plausible and
          credibly distinct from data-based accountability mechanisms. Their
          value is strictly regime-dependent.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Viable only where irreversibility is acceptable and inspection is
            routine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unsuitable for uncontrolled environments or low-value components.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interpretation risks require standardized analysis and training.
          </li>
          <li>
            Misuse may introduce liability, false confidence, or governance
            failure if treated as predictive or fail-safe.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This method functions as a physical deterrent to maintenance neglect
          and record falsification in high-accountability regimes. It must not be
          mistaken for monitoring, safety assurance, or predictive maintenance.
          Deployment demands rigorous engineering discipline, institutional
          transparency, and explicit boundary-setting.
