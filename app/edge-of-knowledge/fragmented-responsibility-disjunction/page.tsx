        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>
          Governance failures are often attributed to ignorance, incompetence,
          or unwillingness. Such explanations fail to account for a distinct
          and recurrent failure mode: situations in which risk is explicitly
          recognized and adequately signaled, yet no accountable intervention
          occurs because responsibility itself is structurally fragmented.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these regimes, failure does not arise from absence of awareness,
          intent, or capability, but from the absence of executable authority.
        </p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Fragmented Responsibility Disjunction is a governance failure mode
          that arises after risk acknowledgment and signaling sufficiency, when
          authority for response is distributed across multiple actors with
          overlapping, partial, or non-hierarchical mandates. No single entity
          is empowered to act unilaterally, and no enforceable collective
          mechanism exists to compel coordinated action.
        </p>
        <p>
          The failure is structural, not epistemic or procedural: risk is known,
          capability exists, but responsibility cannot be executed without
          violating legitimacy constraints.
        </p>

        <h2>Failure Mode Definition</h2>
        <p>
          Fragmented Responsibility Disjunction is present only when all of the
          following conditions hold simultaneously:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Risk is formally recognized and acknowledged</li>
          <li>Signaling is timely, credible, and sufficient</li>
          <li>Capability to respond exists across the system</li>
          <li>
            Authority is divided among multiple entities with overlapping,
            partial, or non-hierarchical mandates
          </li>
          <li>
            No single actor is institutionally authorized to act unilaterally
            without exceeding its legitimate scope
          </li>
          <li>
            No binding mechanism exists to compel coordinated action
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Distinction From Adjacent Failure Modes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Epistemic Lock-In:</strong> Interpretation fails to update;
            here, interpretive consensus exists
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Action Threshold Collapse:</strong> Action itself is
            net-negative; here, action is beneficial but not executable
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Procedural Entrenchment:</strong> Rules block action; here,
            authority itself is misaligned
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Neglect or Omission:</strong> Risk is unrecognized; here,
            recognition is explicit
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Invariant Framework Declaration</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Symmetry group (𝑮):</strong> Redistributions of authority,
          mandate reassignments, and role re-labelings that preserve the total
          set of actors while allowing responsibility to be reconfigured.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Conserved quantity (𝑸):</strong> Aggregate system capability
          to respond to the recognized risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Invariant spectrum (𝑺):</strong> The set of executable
          authority paths—actors or coalitions that can legitimately initiate
          and carry out a response without exceeding mandate or requiring
          external permission.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Failure signature on 𝑺:</strong> The invariant spectrum is
          empty. No legitimate authority path exists despite preserved system
          capability and acknowledged risk.
        </p>

        <h2>Why More Data Cannot Resolve It</h2>
        <p>
          Additional information does not create executable authority. When the
          invariant spectrum is empty, further signaling only reinforces
          awareness without enabling action. The constraint is institutional,
          not informational.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethical Risk of Misuse</h2>
        <p>
          This concept must not be used to diffuse responsibility or absolve
          actors of bad faith. Diagnosing Fragmented Responsibility Disjunction
          requires explicit demonstration that no legitimate authority path
          exists—not merely that coordination is difficult.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>DOCTRINALLY VALID — REGIME-BOUNDED</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Fragmented Responsibility Disjunction identifies a structural failure
          in governance legitimacy: capability exists, risk is known, but no
          actor can act without overstepping authority. The diagnosis forbids
          claims of control, safety, or stewardship until authority is
          explicitly realigned.
        </p>
