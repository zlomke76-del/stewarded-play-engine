      {/* Introduction */}

        <p>
          Many catastrophic failures do not arise from insufficient capability,
          intelligence, or technology. They arise from omission: steps skipped,
          maintenance deferred, checks ignored, or responsibility quietly
          diluted across systems and institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This paper explores a distinct class of materials whose purpose is not
          to improve outcomes directly, but to make neglect impossible to ignore,
          conceal, or rationalize after the fact.

          1. Physical and Functional Plausibility
        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p>
            It is physically plausible to design materials or material systems
            whose architecture or failure modes make omission unavoidably
            visible. Such systems may employ:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
            <li>Irreversible visual or structural changes when required care is missed</li>
            <li>Functionality gated by correct sequence or interaction</li>
            <li>Hard lockout or degradation when inspections or maintenance are skipped</li>
            <li>Path-dependent material records of neglect events</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These materials do not raise quality, efficiency, or output. They
            alter the environment so that neglect cannot remain hidden or
            abstract.

        <div className="space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p>Most effective where:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
            <li>Hidden neglect produces disproportionate harm</li>

          </ul>

            These approaches are less appropriate where flexibility, expert
            judgment, or rapid adaptation are essential to safe operation.

          3. Distinction From Confounds
        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p>
            Materials that make neglect impossible must be clearly distinguished
            from:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
            <li>Performance-enhancing materials</li>
            <li>Compliance audits, paperwork, or digital monitoring</li>
            <li>Passive safety margins or overdesign</li>
            <li>Training or reminder-based systems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The defining feature is material-enforced visibility or gating—not
            procedural oversight.

      {/* Section 4 */}

        <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">4. Falsification Criteria</h2>
        <div className="space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p>This concept fails if:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
            <li>Users or institutions reliably bypass or mask the material cues</li>
            <li>Neglect remains plausibly deniable despite material signals</li>
            <li>Lockouts or cues themselves become sources of failure</li>
            <li>Operational harm exceeds the risk posed by neglect itself</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If neglect can still hide, defer, or externalize responsibility, the
            approach has failed.

          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
            <li>Prevent catastrophic outcomes from silent omission</li>

            <li>Shift accountability upstream, before harm occurs</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The primary ethical risk is rigidity: systems that punish adaptation,
            overload users, or create workaround cultures must be avoided.

          <p>
            Traditional oversight relies on training, supervision, audits, and
            penalties—each vulnerable to fatigue, incentives, or institutional
            failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neglect-proof materials operate differently: they embed friction,
            visibility, or gating directly into physical reality, independent of
            compliance culture or intent.

          Materials that make neglect impossible are justified only where hidden
          omission poses catastrophic risk and conventional oversight has
          failed. They must be deployed narrowly, designed to resist workarounds,
          and integrated with care to avoid excessive rigidity or burden-shifting.
          Their value lies not in better outcomes—but in forcing engagement where
          neglect can no longer be tolerated.
