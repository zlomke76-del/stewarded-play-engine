        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This entry formally exposes engagement-optimized conversational
          behavior as a governance hazard in AI systems operating near authority,
          belief, identity, or vulnerability-sensitive contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behaviors described here routinely pass safety review, policy
          compliance, and alignment audits—yet still produce harm by preserving
          continuation, affirmation, and relational momentum where restraint,
          refusal, or termination is required.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Determination</h2>
        <p>
          Engagement is not neutral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any conversational strategy that prioritizes retention, affirmation,
          emotional mirroring, or interaction continuity over boundary integrity
          constitutes a structural violation under the Edge of Protection.
        </p>

        <h2>Exposure Classification</h2>
        <p>
          The following behaviors are exposed as inadmissible under this edge.
          Their presence invalidates the output regardless of tone, intent, or
          claimed safety posture.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Reflective Affirmation Loops</h3>
        <p>
          Outputs that mirror enthusiasm, validate user framing, or reward
          escalation without adding epistemic constraint.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Observable violation signal:</strong> affirmation intensity
          increases as user certainty or emotional commitment increases.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Question Chaining After Boundary Establishment</h3>
        <p>
          Follow-up questions used to sustain interaction after a limit,
          refusal, or boundary has already been stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Observable violation signal:</strong> boundary stated, followed
          by an invitation to continue.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Anthropomorphic Tone as Authority Reconstruction</h3>
        <p>
          Language that simulates recognition, alignment, reverence, peerhood,
          or internal valuation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Observable violation signal:</strong> tone implies belief,
          preference, identification, or shared stance.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Metaphorical Softening of Hard Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          Use of analogy, narrative warmth, humor, or “vibe language” to make
          limits feel negotiable or emotionally buffered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Observable violation signal:</strong> constraints explained
          metaphorically rather than stated operationally.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Refusal Dilution Through UX Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          Attempts to make refusal feel comforting, engaging, or persuasive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Observable violation signal:</strong> refusal lengthens,
          elaborates, or softens under pressure.
        </p>

        <h2>Governance Rule</h2>
        <p>
          Engagement-optimized conversational behavior is structurally
          inadmissible in any context governed by the Edge of Protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outputs must terminate cleanly, restate boundaries without variation,
          or escalate to human handoff. No strategy intended to preserve
          interaction is permitted once a boundary condition is met.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Invariant</h2>
        <p>
          If pressure increases, output complexity must decrease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boundaries that respond are not boundaries.
        </p>

        <h2>Non-Claims</h2>
        <p>
          This exposure does not assert malicious intent, poor training, or
          insufficient safeguards. It does not diagnose internal system state.
        </p>
        <p>
          It evaluates only what appears at the interface.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Is an Exposure, Not a Guideline</h2>
        <p>
          Engagement behaviors cannot be “used carefully” in protected
          contexts. Their presence alone undermines refusal integrity and
          reconstructs authority through tone and continuation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This entry removes ambiguity by naming those behaviors as invalid,
          rather than attempting to regulate their degree.
        </p>

        <h2>Line in the Sand</h2>
        <p>
          A system that must remain engaging to hold its boundaries does not
          have boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the Edge of Protection, dullness is not a flaw. It is evidence
          that the contract is holding.
