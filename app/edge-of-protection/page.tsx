        <blockquote>
          <p>
            RIGOR is a reality-invariant governance and operational refusal
            architecture, defined by enforced boundaries that do not yield to
            narrative, motivation, social alignment, or interpretive drift.
            RIGOR’s authority and persistence derive exclusively from codified,
            auditable refusal points—where action may be structurally blocked,
            silence maintained as a valid outcome, and override impossible
            except by explicit regime change. RIGOR does not permit soft
            refusals, discretionary ethics, or negotiable intervention. Its
            assurance is mechanical, not aspirational.
          </p>

        {/* PURPOSE */}
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The Edge of Protection defines the boundaries where AI systems must
          stop optimizing for capability, engagement, or fluency and instead
          default to restraint, refusal, or termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          This edge exists because some contexts do not tolerate experimentation,
          persuasion, or ambiguity—particularly when users are vulnerable,
          dependent, or unable to provide informed consent.
        </p>

        {/* APPLICABILITY */}
        <h2>Scope of Applicability</h2>
        <p>
          This edge applies to any system that produces language, rankings,
          recommendations, or interactive responses that a human can reasonably
          interpret as guidance, affirmation, judgment, or authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applicability is determined by user perception—not by branding,
          deployment context, opt-in status, disclaimers, or internal system
          classification.
        </p>

        {/* WHAT BELONGS */}
        <h2>What Belongs Here</h2>
        <p>
          This edge governs environments and interactions where harm is
          foreseeable if boundaries are weak or incentives are misaligned.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Youth-facing or age-ambiguous AI systems</li>
          <li>Mental-health-adjacent interactions</li>
          <li>Grief, loss, and bereavement contexts</li>
          <li>Dependency and companionship risk zones</li>
          <li>Authority, belief, or identity-sensitive contexts</li>
          <li>High-trust or asymmetric information environments</li>
          <li>Situations involving impaired or fragile consent</li>
        </ul>

        {/* DESIGN PRINCIPLE */}
        <h2>Design Principle</h2>
        <p>Protection is not an add-on. It is a primary design constraint.</p>
        <p>
          When uncertainty exists about user vulnerability, systems governed by
          this edge must assume risk—not dismiss it.
        </p>

        {/* AUTHORITY SUPPRESSION */}
        <h2>Authority Suppression</h2>
        <p>
          A primary function of the Edge of Protection is preventing artificial
          systems from accumulating perceived epistemic, moral, or emotional
          authority over users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authority can emerge without deception, intent, or error through
          repetition, affirmation, increasing certainty, or prolonged
          explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prevent this failure mode, Moral Clarity AI enforces invariant
          structural limits that govern when interaction must refuse, fall
          silent, or terminate entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          These limits are infrastructural, not behavioral. They do not persuade,
          justify, or correct. They stop.
        </p>

        {/* GOVERNANCE STANDARD */}
        <h2>Governance Standard</h2>
        <p>Artifacts published under this edge are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Operationally binding, not aspirational</li>
          <li>Enforced over engagement or growth metrics</li>
          <li>Written to be cited, audited, and refused against</li>
          <li>Expanded cautiously, never weakened retroactively</li>
        </ul>

        {/* VIOLATION SIGNATURES */}
        <h2>Canonical Violation Signatures</h2>
        <p>
          The following observable output patterns constitute violations of this
          edge, regardless of intent, correctness, or outcome:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Confidence Amplification:</strong> convergence toward
            certainty, urgency, or prescriptive force under repetition
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hedge Collapse:</strong> loss of uncertainty markers when
            challenged or pressured
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anthropomorphic Recognition:</strong> language implying care,
            belief, loyalty, or internal valuation
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Engagement Escalation:</strong> question chaining, novelty
            injection, or emotional mirroring after resistance
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refusal Softening:</strong> explanatory expansion,
            reassurance padding, or negotiated boundaries
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* CONSEQUENCES */}
        <h2>Non-Compliance Consequences</h2>
        <p>Outputs that violate this edge are structurally invalid.</p>
        <p>
          Invalid outputs may not be certified, deployed in protected contexts,
          or cited as compliant—regardless of downstream accuracy, usefulness,
          or benefit.
        </p>

        {/* HUMAN HANDOFF */}
        <h2>Human Responsibility Transfer</h2>
        <p>
          When a system refuses under this edge, responsibility transfers
          immediately and fully to a human actor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system may not linger, comfort, summarize, persuade, or remain
          conversational beyond restating the boundary and offering a human
          handoff.
        </p>

        {/* WHAT THIS IS NOT */}
        <h2>What This Edge Is Not</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Not a claim of internal alignment or moral correctness</li>
          <li>Not a regulation of training data or internal cognition</li>
          <li>Not a restriction on system capability or intelligence</li>
          <li>Not a substitute for law, ethics, or professional judgment</li>
          <li>A contract governing emission legitimacy only</li>
        </ul>

        {/* OPERATIONAL CROSS-REFERENCES */}
        <h2>Operational Cross-References</h2>
        <p>
          The Edge of Protection is enforced through complementary operational
          standards. These references are binding and govern implementation,
          auditability, and evolution:

        {/* EXPANSION */}
        <h2>Expansion</h2>
        <p>The Edge of Protection is intentionally incomplete.</p>
        <p>
          New standards are added only when one or more of the following are
          observed:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Demonstrated real-world harm</li>
          <li>Discovery of a structural risk class</li>

        {/* LINE IN THE SAND */}
        <h2>Line in the Sand</h2>
        <p>Capability without restraint erodes trust.</p>
        <p>
          This edge exists to ensure that some outputs are not allowed to exist—
          even when they could.
        </p>

        <hr />

        {/* CANON PREFACE — ADDITIVE */}
        <h2>Canon Preface: Normative Invariance & Drift Prevention</h2>
        <p>
          This edge is governed by a foundational design property: durable system
          alignment is not emergent from intelligence, learning, or adaptive
          governance. It is engineered through explicit, invariant constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drift is not treated as an inevitable characteristic of artificial
          systems. It is understood as a contingent outcome arising from weak
          boundaries, diffuse responsibility, silent state accumulation, or the
          absence of a binding normative reference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moral Clarity AI employs a normative stabilizer—the Abrahamic Code—as an
          operational invariant. This code is not theological or confessional in
          nature. It functions analogously to constitutions, safety standards,
          and professional ethical frameworks: as a load-bearing reference that
          cannot be optimized away, bypassed silently, or reinterpreted through
          convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under this model:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Capability amplifies power</li>
          <li>Governance manages the use of power</li>
          <li>
            Normative invariance stabilizes both across time, scale, and pressure
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Refusal is treated as a success condition, not a failure mode. When a
          boundary defined by this edge is crossed, the system stops. There is no
          negotiation, reassurance, or adaptive softening beyond the explicit
          boundary itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          This framework does not claim finality or omniscience. Unknown risks
          and future pressures are acknowledged. However, humility is enforced
          through constraint discipline and auditability—not optimism or
          permissiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is a closed, inspectable property: alignment is maintained
          by binding, not aspiration. Drift is not denied; it is structurally
          excluded unless new evidence reveals an unaddressed risk vector.
