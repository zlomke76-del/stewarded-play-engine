      <h1>EDTA-Ligand Functional PET</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        PET incorporating EDTA-like ligands is evaluated for heavy-metal
        scavenging and remediation.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Heavy metal contamination poses persistent public health risks.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        EDTA-analog diacids or diols are covalently incorporated into PET.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Repeated metal binding and release cycles. Loss of binding capacity
        after five cycles constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        PET filters capable of repeated heavy-metal capture without leaching.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Enables safer drinking water and reduced heavy-metal toxicity exposure.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Anchored chelation in PET offers durable remediation if cycling
        stability is demonstrated.
