      <h1>PEG-Diacid PET Copolymer</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Short-chain PEG diacids are incorporated into PET to improve flexibility
        and biocompatibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        PEG improves softness and water compatibility but must remain covalently
        bound to prevent leaching.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Low-molecular-weight PEG diacids are copolymerized into PET at low mol%
        during synthesis.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Repeated water uptake and desorption cycles. Greater than 15% mass drift
        constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        Retained PEG enables flexible, soft-touch, and biocompatible PET formats.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Reduces complications in medical and consumer applications and supports
        longer-lived alternatives to single-use products.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        PEG-diacid PET extends comfort and medical utility if hydration stability
        is demonstrated.
