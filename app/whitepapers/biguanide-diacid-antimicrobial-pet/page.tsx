      <h1>Biguanide Diacid–Functional Antimicrobial PET</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        PET functionalized with covalently bound biguanide diacids is explored
        for stable antimicrobial surface behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Biguanides provide broad antimicrobial activity but require anchoring
        to prevent leaching and toxicity risk.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Biguanide-functional diacids are incorporated during PET synthesis at
        low molar levels.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Soxhlet extraction followed by antimicrobial assay. Loss of function or
        less than 90% retention constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        Stable antimicrobial PET surfaces without mobile additives.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Reduces infection risk in medical, packaging, and water-contact systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Anchored biguanide PET enables safer antimicrobial materials if
        extraction resistance is achieved.
