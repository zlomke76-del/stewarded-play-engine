      <h1>Phosphonate-Diol–PET Copolymer</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        PET copolymers incorporating phosphonate-functional diols are evaluated
        for durable, non-leaching flame-retardant capability.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Phosphonate groups offer flame-retardant behavior but require covalent
        anchoring to avoid extraction and loss of performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Phosphonate-functional diols are co-condensed with PET monomers at
        controlled low mol% to ensure uniform incorporation.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Hot water extraction at 80°C for 24 hours followed by ICP-OES phosphorus
        quantification. Greater than 10% phosphorus loss constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        Successful materials retain phosphonate functionality and enable
        persistent flame-retardant behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Reduces fire-related injury and property loss, lowering human harm and
        replacement cost.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Covalently anchored phosphonate PET expands safe flame-retardant polymer
        options if extraction resistance is achieved.
