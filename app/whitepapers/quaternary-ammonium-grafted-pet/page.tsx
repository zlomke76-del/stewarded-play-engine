      <h1>Quaternary Ammonium–Grafted PET</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Quaternary ammonium sites are grafted onto PET to explore durable,
        non-leaching antimicrobial surface potential.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Antimicrobial surfaces require covalent attachment to prevent migration
        and health risk.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Quaternized aminoalkyl methacrylate monomers are melt-grafted to PET using
        radical initiation at controlled loadings.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Methanol/water Soxhlet extraction followed by XPS analysis. Less than 90%
        N⁺ retention constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        Persistent cationic surfaces capable of antimicrobial activity if
        anchoring is maintained.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Supports reduced pathogen transmission and lower healthcare burden in
        public-facing environments.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Grafted quaternary ammonium PET offers antimicrobial potential contingent
        on extraction stability.
