      <h1>Catechol-Bearing PET (Adhesion-Enhanced PET)</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Catechol-functional PET is evaluated for enhanced adhesion to metals,
        glass, and biological substrates without mobile adhesives.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Catechol chemistry, inspired by mussel adhesion, enables strong bonding
        under wet and dry conditions when covalently anchored.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Catechol-modified diacids or diols are incorporated into PET during
        polycondensation at low molar fractions.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Surface peel testing after repeated wet/dry cycling. Greater than 10%
        adhesion loss relative to baseline constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        PET components capable of durable adhesion without migrating bonding
        agents.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Enables safer and more reliable medical devices and assemblies while
        reducing adhesive-related toxicity and failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Anchored catechol PET supports adhesion-critical applications if cycling
        stability is confirmed.
