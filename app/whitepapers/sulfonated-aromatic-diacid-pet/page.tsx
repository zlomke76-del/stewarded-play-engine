      <h1>Sulfonated Aromatic Diacid–PET Copolymer</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This paper explores PET functionalized with covalently incorporated
        sulfonated aromatic diacids to enable fixed-charge and hydration
        capability for advanced packaging and textiles.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        PET lacks intrinsic surface charge or hydration control. Sulfonated
        aromatic diacids enable polar site integration when covalently anchored.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Sulfonate-bearing diacids are introduced during polycondensation at
        controlled molar inclusion (0.1–1.5 mol%).
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Aging at 85°C / 85% RH for 500 hours. Failure is defined as greater than
        10% absolute loss in DSC crystallinity or tensile strength.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        Passing samples exhibit durable fixed-charge and hydration properties,
        enabling static resistance and improved cleanliness.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Reduces contamination risk, supports reusable packaging, and lowers
        single-use plastic waste with downstream public health benefit.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Anchored sulfonated PET offers a viable pathway to hygienic,
        static-resistant materials if durability criteria are met.
