      <h1>Epoxy-Modified PET (Epoxy Diacid Copolymer)</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Epoxy-functional diacids are copolymerized into PET to enhance adhesion
        and barrier properties.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Improved bonding and reduced permeability extend product lifespan and
        performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Glycidyl-functional diacids are incorporated during PET synthesis at low
        molar fractions.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Acid hydrolysis in 1M HCl for 24 hours. Less than 90% epoxy retention
        constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        Enhanced adhesion and reduced permeability in PET films.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Reduces leakage, spoilage, and material throughput across packaging and
        infrastructure applications.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Anchored epoxy PET supports longer-lasting, lighter products when
        hydrolytic stability is confirmed.
