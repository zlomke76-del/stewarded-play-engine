      <h1>Ionic Liquid–Mimic Antistatic PET</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        PET incorporating covalently coupled ionic liquid fragments is
        investigated for durable antistatic behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Electrostatic buildup compromises safety and performance in electronics,
        filtration, and medical environments.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Ionic-liquid-mimic diacids or diols are incorporated into PET to provide
        anchored ionic conductivity.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Multi-cycle surface conductivity measurement combined with extraction
        testing. Greater than 10% conductivity loss constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        Durable antistatic PET surfaces without migrating additives.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Reduces electrostatic risk, contamination buildup, and premature device
        or filter failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Anchored ionic fragments enable long-life antistatic PET when extraction
        stability is achieved.
