      <h1>Cyanate Ester–PET Copolymer</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Aromatic cyanate esters are incorporated into PET to improve thermal
        durability.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        High-temperature environments demand greater dimensional and mechanical
        stability.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Low mol% aromatic cyanate esters are introduced during PET synthesis,
        forming stable triazine structures.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Heat exposure at 250°C for 1 hour. Greater than 10% cyano IR loss
        constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        PET with elevated thermal resistance and form stability.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Enables longer-lived components in transportation and infrastructure—
        fewer failures and replacements.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Cyanate-modified PET supports high-heat applications if functional
        retention is maintained.
