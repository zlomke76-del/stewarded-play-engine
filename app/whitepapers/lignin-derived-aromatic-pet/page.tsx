      <h1>Lignin-Derived Aromatic PET Copolymer</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        PET copolymers incorporating lignin-derived aromatic diacids are explored
        as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based aromatics.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Lignin is an abundant bio-refinery byproduct with underutilized aromatic
        content.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Aromatic diacids derived from lignin are co-condensed into PET during
        synthesis at controlled levels.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Soxhlet extraction followed by UV-Vis or NMR analysis. Less than 90%
        aromatic retention constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        PET incorporating renewable aromatic content with maintained structural
        integrity.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Reduces fossil dependence, valorizes industrial waste streams, and
        lowers environmental impact.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Lignin-derived PET supports sustainable polymer supply chains if
        extraction resistance is confirmed.
