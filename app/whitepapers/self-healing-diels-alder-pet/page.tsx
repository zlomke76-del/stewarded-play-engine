      <h1>Self-Healing PET via Diels–Alder Chemistry</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        PET incorporating dynamic Diels–Alder adducts is investigated for
        intrinsic self-healing behavior under controlled thermal conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Dynamic covalent bonds can reversibly reform, allowing recovery from
        microcracking and mechanical damage.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Furan- or maleimide-functional diacids are incorporated to enable
        reversible crosslinking within the PET matrix.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Cyclic mechanical testing with intermediate heat-rest cycles. Greater
        than 10% mechanical loss after five healing cycles constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        PET materials capable of recovering mechanical integrity after minor
        damage.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Extends product lifetimes, reduces maintenance cycles, and lowers
        landfill waste across industrial applications.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Self-healing PET is viable if reversible bonding survives repeated
        mechanical and thermal cycling.
