      <h1>Carboxylic Acid–Modified PET</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        PET modified with pendant carboxylic acids is examined for improved
        chemical resistance and container durability.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Certain applications expose PET to aggressive chemical environments.
        Anchored acid groups can enhance resistance and longevity.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Dicarboxylic acids with pendant functionality are copolymerized into PET
        during melt synthesis at low molar fractions.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        Soxhlet water extraction followed by acid titration. Less than 90% acid
        retention constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        Passing materials exhibit enhanced chemical resistance and stable
        container performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Reduces spoilage, contamination risk, and material waste in food,
        beverage, and pharmaceutical handling.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Extraction-resistant carboxylated PET extends safe-use lifetimes in
        demanding storage environments.
