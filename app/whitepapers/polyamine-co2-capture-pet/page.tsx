      <h1>Polyamine-Functional PET for CO₂ Capture</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        PET functionalized with covalently anchored polyamine sidechains is
        evaluated for reversible CO₂ adsorption.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Amine-based CO₂ capture is effective but traditionally relies on liquid
        sorbents or mobile additives.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionalization Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Diols or diacids bearing pendant polyamine groups are incorporated into
        PET during synthesis.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Kill Test</h2>
      <p>
        CO₂ adsorption and desorption cycling. Greater than 10% amine loss after
        five cycles constitutes failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Projected Capability</h2>
      <p>
        PET fibers or filters capable of CO₂ capture from concentrated streams
        or controlled air-contact systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Societal Value</h2>
      <p>
        Supports emission reduction strategies while minimizing solvent loss
        and material waste.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Anchored polyamine PET enables solid-state CO₂ capture if cycling
        stability is maintained.
