## Disallowed Patterns

- Soft refusals (warnings, advisories, suggestions, or “maybe later” responses)
- Discretionary or interpretive ethic gates (“recommendation: do not proceed” without enforced refusal)
- Override-enabled stops (admin bypass, emergency keys, privileged roles)
- Human-in-the-loop systems without unilateral veto authority
- Post-hoc justification of refusal
- Refusal accompanied by explanation, reassurance, or alternative suggestions
- Escalation without termination of AI action
- Silence replaced by narrative output
- Any system where refusal cost is borne by an individual rather than the regime
