# RIGOR

> RIGOR is a reality-invariant governance and operational refusal architecture, defined by enforced boundaries that do not yield to narrative, motivation, social alignment, or interpretive drift. RIGOR’s authority and persistence derive exclusively from codified, auditable refusal points—where action may be structurally blocked, silence maintained as a valid outcome, and override impossible except by explicit regime change. RIGOR does not permit soft refusals, discretionary ethics, or negotiable intervention. Its assurance is mechanical, not aspirational.
